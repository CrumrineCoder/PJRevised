# Penny Jane's Cookies Website

This is a portfolio website for a local NYC cookie bakery and decorating business called Penny Jane's Cookies. The site uses PHP for email forms. 

I worked with a client to develop the strategy behind the website. The website was developed with an Agile/Skrum methodology for scheduling, planning, and prioritizing. I worked with my Senior Designer brother to design for this strategy and I implemented the designs we made. The initial design as for the client to share between her friends but it as expanded to be useful for cold-dropping clients with in an email as well as pulling users from Google. I also did competitive analysis and did both independent research and weekly discussion with the other designer. 

## To Do

* Set up mailing list to be a checkbox when placing an order or booking / joining a class.
